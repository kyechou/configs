# Gargoyle Glk configuration
#-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# Gargoyle will look for configuration files and load them in this
# order, with later settings overriding earlier settings:
#
#   1: same directory as the executable: garglk.ini (windows)
#   2: /etc/garglk.ini (or other location set at build time, Unix only)
#   3: Platform-specific locations:
#          $HOME/.garglkrc (unix)
#          ${XDG_CONFIG_HOME:-$HOME/.config}/garglk.ini (unix)
#          <user settings directory>/Gargoyle (haiku)
#          %APPDATA%/Gargoyle/garglk.ini (windows)
#          current working directory: garglk.ini (windows)
#          $HOME/garglk.ini (mac)
#   4: game directory: garglk.ini
#   5: name-of-game-file.ini (so for hell.gam it would read hell.ini)
#
# Sections of the config file can be turned on or off by matching
# either the interpreter or game file being run. See the bottom
# of this file for examples.

# In addition to a user's specific config file, games can provide their
# own config file to overwrite some or all of a user's settings. This
# can be disabled by setting the following option to 0.
game_config   1

scrollwidth   0               # set to 8 to make a nice scrollbar
scrollbg      b0b0b0
scrollfg      808080

# By default, games/interpreters are allowed to change the appearance of
# Gargoyle to some degree: colors can be set, reverse video can be set, and the
# appearance of Glk styles can be changed (allowing interpreters to change what
# the style "emphasized" means, for example). Setting this to 0 disables this
# behavior: colors can't be used, reverse video can't be used, and stylehint
# settings are ignored. The impetus for this option was to allow users to
# disable games whose colors they found distasteful.
stylehint     1

safeclicks    1               # set to 0 if game cancels line events properly

cols          60              # nice good line length for reading. but...
rows          25              # see the bottom for terp-specific over-rides

lockcols      0               # set to 1 to enforce col count
lockrows      0               # set to 1 to enforce row count

# Gargoyle can try to restore the last window size and window location.
# This is generally only provided as a hint to the window system, and
# may be ignored. Window location restoration is not supported on macOS,
# but is supported on all other operating systems. The value is
# whitespace-delimited strings taking the value "size" or "location":
#
# save_window size
# save_window location
# save_window size location
#
# The default is to save neither. If Gargoyle is able to restore a
# saved window size, then the "cols" and "rows" settings are ignored.

justify       0               # 0=ragged-right 1=justified
quotes        1               # Smart quotes           -- 0=off 1=normal 2=rabid
dashes        1               # Dash replacement level -- 0=off 1=-,em 2=-,en,em
spaces        1               # Spaces after full stop -- 0=off 1=one 2=two
caps          0               # Force uppercase input  -- 0=off 1=on

graphics      1               # enable graphics
sound         1               # enable sound

# Gargoyle provides support for the Z-Machine's sound effects 1 and 2.
# The Z-Machine Standards Document 1.1 says this about so-called bleeps:
#
# "Number 1 is a high-pitched bleep, number 2 a low-pitched one"
#
# Here you can define what the bleeps sound like. The syntax is this:
#
# zbleep number duration frequency
#
# number is either 1 or 2
# duration is the duration, in seconds, and can be fractional
# frequency is the pitch in Hz (440 = A5), and must be integral
#
# This creates a pure (sinusoidal) tone at the given frequency.
#
# To disable a bleep, set its duration to 0. The defaults here mimic
# Infocom's DOS interpreter. To mimic Infocom's C128 interpreter:
#
# zbleep        1 0.1 1480
# zbleep        2 0.1 660
#
# Instead of a generated tone, you can provide a file to be used as the
# bleep. This has the syntax:
#
# zbleep_file   1 /path/to/file.aiff
# zbleep_file   2 /path/to/file.aiff
#
# The file should be a Blorb-supported file (AIFF or Ogg Vorbis),
# although Gargoyle also currently supports, as extensions to Blorb, WAV
# and MP3 files.
zbleep        1 0.1 1175
zbleep        2 0.1 440

# Fonts have gaps in their coverage of characters. Historically when your
# preferred font didn't support a particular character, Gargoyle rendered it as
# a question mark. Now GNU Unifont is included, and used as a fallback for
# glyphs that don't exist in the primary font. Unifont has complete coverage of
# the Basic Multilingual Plane and wide coverage of the Supplementary
# Multilingual Plane. However, it is a rather utilitarian font, so if you'd
# like to use different fonts as fallbacks, you can do so here. You can specify
# as many fallback fonts as you want, with the higher priority ones listed
# first. Unifont will still be used as a last resort.
#
# Unifont will substitute for both proportional and monospace fonts, but if you
# provide your own proportional substitute font, it will not look good in
# monospace. Therefore, when you supply your own fallback fonts, you can specify
# whether they are proportional, monospace, or both.
#
# You can specify as many fonts as you want, separated by space. First-listed
# fonts have higher priority.
#
# Font paths must be absolute: the behavior of relative paths is unspecified.
# Fonts can be OpenType, TrueType, or Type 1.
#
# The syntax is:
#
# glyph_substitution_file style /path/to/font [/path_to_font...]
#
# Where "style" is:
# • monor, monob, monoi, monoz, propr, propb, propi, propz
#   (monospace/proportional regular, bold, italic, bold italic)
# • mono (all monospace styles)
# • prop (all proportional styles)
# • * (both monospace and proportional styles)
#
# Gargoyle will generate, as necessary, bold and italic styles, so if there's a
# font you like, but it only has, for example, regular and bold variants:
#
# glyph_substitution_file propb /fonts/Bold.ttf
# glyph_substitution_file propz /fonts/Bold.ttf
# glyph_substitution_file prop /fonts/Regular.ttf
#
# Or if a font only has regular:
#
# glyph_substitution_file prop /fonts/Regular.ttf
#
# Remember that the first-listed font has higher priority, so list more specific
# fonts first (e.g. propr before prop, and prop before *).

# Text LCD Filtering
#-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# When using LCD subpixel rendering, the filter used (if not set otherwise) will
# be equivalent to the filter Gargoyle has always used. This looks fairly good
# without gamma correction, but might be blurrier than some people prefer.
#
# The available values for lcdfilter are:
#
#   1: none (equiv. custom filter: 0 0 255 0 0)
#      This filter looks very ugly and is not recommended. However, it is the
#      absolute sharpest, and when used with the correct gamma value on a high-
#      DPI display, can give the clearest and sharpest possible text.
#
#   2: default (equiv. custom filter: 8, 77, 86, 77, 8)
#      This is not the default filter for Gargoyle, but it is FreeType's default
#      filter for LCD rendering. It's similar to Gargoyle's, but a tad sharper,
#      and is color balanced (the values for the filter add up to 256), unlike
#      Gargoyle's filter (which add up to less than - but close to - 256, which
#      can sometimes lead to slightly pale colors when using gamma correction).
#
#   3: light (equiv. custom filter: 0 85 86 85 0)
#      This filter is color-balanced like the default one, but is as sharp as
#      possible while also attempting to eliminate color fringes caused by the
#      use of subpixel rendering. However, while using 'default' will also help
#      eliminate such color fringes while not using gamma correction (by setting
#      gamma to 1.0), this 'light' filter is less forgiving. Using 'light' is
#      generally recommended most when using the appropriate gamma correction
#      for your display.
#
#   4: legacy (no equiv. custom filter; uses different algorithm)
#      This filter is similar to 'none', but with its effect significantly toned
#      down. The result is a very sharp filter that might not be TOO noticeable.
#      However, it was designed for fully hinted text that's been snapped to the
#      pixel grid of the display, and causes severe color fringes otherwise.
#      Since Gargoyle does not use font hinting, the color fringes caused by
#      this filter can be just as noticeable as the ones caused by 'none'.
#
# If any other value is set, the custom filter is used. If one is not set, the
# custom filter will use values equivalent to how Gargoyle has filtered subpixel
# text in the past. By default, Gargoyle does not use gamma correction.
#
# When using gamma correction and LCD subpixel font rendering, it's recommended
# to set lcdfilter to either 'default' or 'light'.
#
# If you choose your own filter, it's recommended to follow the advice at the
# top of the following FreeType documentation page:
# https://www.freetype.org/freetype2/docs/reference/ft2-lcd_rendering.html

# Instead of needing to specify individual colors, Gargoyle supports the concept
# of color themes, which set all possible colors at once. There are two
# hard-coded themes: "light" and "dark". In addition, there is a pseudo theme
# called "system" which attempts to follow the system theme, setting a dark or
# light theme as appropriate.
# Gargoyle also comes with several other themes, and you can provide your own
# themes as well. To see a list of available themes, use Shift-Control-T while
# Gargoyle is running. To see a list of theme paths (where you can add your own
# themes), use Control-period. MacOS users subtitute Command for Control.
# This must come after all other color settings, or they will override the theme.
# See THEMES.md for information on how themes are created.

# The following apply only if TTS is enabled.
# speak_input    0           # 1=speak input the player types, 0=don't speak input

# speak_language en          # if supported by the TTS engine, the language used
